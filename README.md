# mgsvtpp - aspect ratio fix
Patching MGSV for nonstandard resolutions

##Requirements 
 - node.js (https://nodejs.org/). Make sure you add it to PATH
 
##Issues
 - doesn't fix markers

##Commandline usage

    node app.js

Application will try to automatically detect display resolution and game install location and if it fails, you will be able to enter correct info.

I cannot guarantee it will work (it should even if they change offset) for future patches or for people with different resolutions. I've only tested it on my (2560x1080) display on patch 1.0.4.3

At least it shouldn't break anything.

Thanks to wsgf.org and jackfuste, yuo are pretty good.
